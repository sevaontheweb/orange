# Orange
Simple template for static html single-page personal website.

Live demo: https://sevaontheweb.github.io/orange/

## Licence
"People" section is a mockup for Clients / Our Team / Testimonials block, just for instance. Please substitute your own letterings and images.

As for the rest, feel free to (re)use and change for your needs until they stay legal.


## Contact form
This is static html page with no programmable backend. To enable contact form, use one of services that provide resending the message to your email:
- https://formspree.io/
- http://www.enformed.io/
- https://www.formbucket.com/

etc..

You will need to edit `action="#"` attribute of the `<form ..... >` tag as the service requires:

`<form method="post" action="_this_value_you_edit_" id="contact-me">`
